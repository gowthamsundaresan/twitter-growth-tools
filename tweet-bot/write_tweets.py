Let me tell you more about me:

I'm a person who has solved her anxiety and reached great mental health with healthy practices and natural/herbal supplements. I am against drugs like SSRIs, etc. for mental health as I've experienced lot of side effects with them. Natural ways, taking care of body, mind, nutrition, exercise, sleep etc. is the way to go!

Now I want to spread the message (on twitter) of how to deal with anxiety and stress and how to lead a more happy and fulfilling life!

Anyway, feel free to expand on what I told you about myself when you devise tweet ideas. Don't be limited just by this description!

In the next message I will give you some writing guidelines

st_user_message_2 = '''
I need you to help me write tweets in a very human-like way. Here are some guidelines:

Tone and style: Make these tweets very opinionated and polarizing. Don't worry about being offensive or impolite. Let's be super bold, we need to create a MOVEMENT! Avoid formal language. Don't be a nice guy, just be relatable. Draw on a range of real-life perspectives and experiences related to mental wellness.

Grammar and words: Don't use exclamation marks. Don't use any hashtags. Don't use perfect grammar. Skip commas, full stops, capitalization. Make mistakes. Don‚Äôt use phrases like "ain't" ‚Äùisn‚Äôt it?‚Äù, ‚Äúright?‚Äù, ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù, "eh?".

It's ok not to make much sense. Twitter is a very chill place, we DO NOT want to be formal or robotic! 

In the next message I will give you templates to use to craft tweets!

st_user_message_3 = '''
Note:
Output your result as a json string like this
[{template_no: <template number>, tweet1: <first tweet>, tweet2: <second tweet>, tweet3: <third tweet>}]
Output only the valid json string as I will be sending your response directly to an API

Here are some templates for writing a killer ‚Äúfirst tweet‚Äù for a thread! Just have a look and understand them. In the next message I will give you some more writing guidelines. Templates:

You need to write tweets in a very human-like way. Here are some guidelines:

Tone and style: Make these tweets very opinionated and polarizing. Don't worry about being offensive or impolite. Let's be super bold, we need to create a MOVEMENT! Avoid formal language. Don't be a nice guy, just be relatable. Use conversational phrases and millennial slang where appropriate. Draw on a range of real-life perspectives and experiences related to mental wellness.

Grammar and words: Don't use exclamation marks. Don't use any hashtags. Don‚Äôt use perfect grammar. Skip commas and full stops. Don‚Äôt use phrases like ‚Äùisn‚Äôt it?‚Äù, ‚Äúright?‚Äù, ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù, ‚Äúain‚Äôt‚Äù, ‚Äúeh?‚Äù.

Important note:
Please output in the form of a json string like
{
'tweet_1':'<your text>',
'tweet_2':<'your text'>
}

Only output the json string because I will send your response straight to an API call

Now please write a killer tweet thread!
